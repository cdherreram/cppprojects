# CPP projects

In this repository you can find some simulations done in C++. These projects were design in the course "Computational tools" in National University of Colombia in Physics Department of
the university. It contains some approches in simulation techniques and some developments implemented as Parallel Programming, Automatization and Testing.

All projects were written in Spanish. The authors can be found in the README of each project.

##  proyectointermedio

Project about percolation theory in statistical physics with an approach with recursive functions and bidimensional arrays. The final project contains some feautures about the theory,
and the obtained results in the simulation.

## proyecto-final

Final project in the course where we design a model to evaluate the impact of isolation in an epidemic, designed with some tools in POO and agent-based model. The results show that there
are an impact in the propagation of the epidemic and we calculated the proportion of this situation.
